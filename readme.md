# Kirby Plugins

**The unofficial **[plugin list](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues)** for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/).**

In this repository a plugin is anything related to Kirby, that is not a theme.

## Search for a plugin

The best way to find plugins is to [search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues) for them. If that does not work, you can browse the labels (next chapter).

## Labels

Every plugin has one or more labels. It makes it easier to find what you are looking for in the search, but it does also make it easier to browse for plugins.

### Label groups

All the labels is included in a group. All the groups is listed below:

## Submit a plugin

1. [Search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues) for the plugin to make sure it does not already exist.
1. [Add the plugin](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues/new).
1. Don't close the issue.

You can only add labels if you are a collaborator. I can change the privileges when needed.

## Report a plugin

If the plugin is **broken**, is **malware** or is **duplicate** (already exists in the plugin list), add a comment in the plugin issue. If others agree, we can label it. Don't close the issue!

## Requirements

The requirement for using these plugins is Kirby 2. If you are still using Kirby 1 (which is now deprecated) we encourage you to update for compatibility and security reasons.

## Responsibility

This repository does not take any responsibility for the harm the plugins can do. 

## Kirby themes

**[Kirby themes](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes)** - the unofficial [theme list](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes/issues) for Kirby CMS.

## Special thanks to
