You can also [search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues) for the plugin.

## Submit a plugin

1. [Search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues) for the plugin to make sure it does not already exist.
1. [Add the plugin](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues/new).
1. Don't close the issue.

You can only add labels if you are a collaborator. I can change the privileges when needed.

## Report a plugin

If the plugin is **broken**, is **malware** or is **duplicate** (already exists in the plugin list), add a comment in the plugin issue. If others agree, we can label it. Don't close the issue!

## Requirements

The requirement for using these plugins is Kirby 2. If you are still using Kirby 1 (which is now deprecated) we encourage you to update for compatibility and security reasons.

## Responsibility

This repository does not take any responsibility for the harm the plugins can do.

## Kirby themes

**[Kirby themes](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes)** - the unofficial [theme list](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes/issues) for Kirby CMS.

## Future ideas

- A website built with [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) to make the plugins more visually appealing.

## Special thanks to

I would also like to thank everyone that contributes to this repo, one way or the other.
